## Since Option

By default, Cody logs searches only 7 days in the past. This is done for speed. If you have an older build and would like to search further in the past.  You can use the `--since option`.  Example:

    cody logs --since 1m # 1 month ago

The since format is from the [aws-logs gem](https://github.com/tongueroo/aws-logs). Since formats:

* s - seconds
* m - minutes
* h - hours
* d - days
* w - weeks

Since does not current support combining the formats. IE: 5m30s.
