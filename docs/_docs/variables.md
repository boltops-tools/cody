title: Variables Support
nav_order: 5

The codebuild tool supports the concept of variables. Variables allow you to set environment-specific variables. For example, development and production environments usually require the same code but use different variables.

Within the `.codebuild/variables` folder, you can create variable files and the variables defined in them are made available to your `.codebuild` DSL files.  Examples:

    .codebuild/project.rb
    .codebuild/role.rb
    .codebuild/schedule.rb

## Structure

Here's an example variables structure:

    .codebuild
    └── variables
        ├── base.rb
        ├── development.rb
        └── production.rb

## Layering Support

The variable files are layered together. The `base.rb` and specific `CB_ENV `variable file, like `development.rb`, are combined. An example helps explain.   Let's say you have these files:

base.rb:

```ruby
@myvar = "base-value"
```

development.rb:

```ruby
@myvar = "development-value"
```

production.rb:

```ruby
@myvar = "production-value"
```

Then you can do this:

    cb deploy # defaults to CB_ENV=development

Since `CB_ENV=development` is the default, this means `@myvar = "development-value"` is used.

If we want to use production values, then we can set `CB_ENV=production`

    CB_ENV=production cb deploy

In this case, `@myvar = "production-value"` is used.

Now if we use `CB_ENV=staging`

    CB_ENV=staging cb deploy

In this case, `@myvar = "base-value"` is used, since there is no `staging.rb` file.

## Variables with -\-type Option

With codebuild, we can use a `--type` option to create additional codebuild projects under the `.codebuild` folder.  Here's a short example:

    cb deploy --type deploy

The buildspec file it'll use is here:

    .codebuild/deploy/buildspec.yml

More info on the type option is here: [Type Option]({% link _docs/type-option.md %}).

Specific project type variables can be set. For example, let's say you have a `--type=deploy`, the variable files that will be used are:

    .codebuild/deploy/variables/base.rb
    .codebuild/deploy/variables/developemnt.rb

The type specific variable files override the top-level variable files. Type specific variable files get loaded last so they take the highest precedence.  Example:

    .codebuild/variables/base.rb - lowest precedence
    .codebuild/variables/developemnt.rb
    .codebuild/deploy/variables/base.rb
    .codebuild/deploy/variables/developemnt.rb - highest precedence

The top-level variables files are also loaded because it is common to need variables that are available to all projects.
