The CodeBuild project is generated from the DSL and created with CloudFormation. By default, the files that the DSL evaluates are:

    .cody/buildspec.yml
    .cody/project.rb
    .cody/role.rb

To create the CodeBuild project, you run:

    cody deploy

You'll see output that looks something like this:

    $ cody deploy
    Generated CloudFormation template at /tmp/codebuild.yml
    Deploying stack demo-cb with CodeBuild project demo
    Creating stack demo-cb. Check CloudFormation console for status.

## Explicit CodeBuild Project Name

By default, the CodeBuild project name is inferred and is the parent folder that you are within.  You can explicitly specify the project name as the first CLI argument:

    cody deploy my-project

## Types

By default, cody looks up files in the `.cody` folder.  Example:

    .cody/buildspec.yml
    .cody/project.rb
    .cody/role.rb

You can use the `--type` option to tell the tool to lookup files in a subfolder.  Here's an example.

    cody deploy PROJECT_NAME --type deploy

This will look up `buildspec.yml`, `project.rb`, and `role.rb` files in the `.cody/deploy` folder. So:

    .cody/deploy/buildspec.yml
    .cody/deploy/project.rb
    .cody/deploy/role.rb

Likewise `cody deploy PROJECT_NAME --type unit` would result in:

    .cody/unit/buildspec.yml
    .cody/unit/project.rb
    .cody/unit/role.rb

Also, for help info you can check the [cody deploy]({% link _reference/cb-deploy.md %}) CLI reference.
