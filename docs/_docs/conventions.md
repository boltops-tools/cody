title: Naming Conventions

The codebuild tool follows a few naming conventions.

## Project Name

It will set the codebuild project name by inferring the name of the parent folder.  For example, if the parent folder is `demo`.

    cd demo
    cody deploy

The CodeBuild project is named `demo`. You can override this easily by providing a project name.

    cd deploy my-project # explicitly use my-project as CodeBuild project name

The CodeBuild project is named `my-project`

## Type Option

If the `--type` option is used, then it is appended to the CodeBuild project name. For example:

    cody deploy my-project --type unit

The CodeBuild project is named `my-project-unit`.

## CB_ENV_EXTRA

The `CB_ENV_EXTRA` also affects the name of the CodeBuild project.  It gets appended after the type option.

    CB_ENV_EXTRA=2 cody deploy my-project --type unit

The CodeBuild project is named `my-project-unit-2`.

## Settings append_env option

If the append_env is configured in the [Settings]({% link _docs/settings.md %}).

## Stack Name

The CloudFormation stack name which creates the CodeBuild related resources is named the same as the project name with `-cb` appended to the stack name. Examples:

CodeBuild Project Name | Stack Name
--- | ---
demo | demo-cb
demo-unit | demo-unit-cb
demo-web-unit | demo-web-unit-cb
